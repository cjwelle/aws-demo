This repo is an example of using Ansible and AWS Commands to launch AWS CloudFormation templates to build VPC's and use [HashiCorp Packer](https://packer.io) to Build AMI's along with cleaning up of the VPC after done.

This documentation will provide commands that install applications on your local machine, launch virtual machines that are used to build and launch AWS services in AWS US-East-2 (Ohio).

### PreRequisite
You will need to have a AWS Account and your AWSCLI already setup. For more information on how to do this please go to this website for instructions regarding your computer. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

## Kitchen Server
The kitchen server for this repo requires [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with [Vagrant-vbguest plugin](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) and [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed on the host machine.

#### Vagrant Setup - Mac

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is required to move forward in this setup.

```bash
$ brew cask install virtualbox vagrant
```

#### Install the Vagrant plugin vbguest

```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

#### Start up Kitchen Server
Download the AWS-Demo Git repo
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cjwelle/aws-demo.git
$ cd aws-demo
```

#### Startup Vagrant box.
```bash
$ vagrant up
```

NOTE: This could take up to 30 mins to start. This will launch a vagrant box and run the kitchen.yml file against the vagrant box.

#### Log into the Vagrant box

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
```

#### Verify that your AWS credentials are passed through.
```bash
$ aws s3 ls
```

#### Change directory to workfolder before running the commands below.
```bash
$ cd ~/workfolder
```

###Virtual Private Cloud
The VPC's are required to be built first before building the AMI's. This section will build a single VPC across two AZ's with a 4 subnets (2 Public and 2 Private), S3 & DynmoDB Endpoints, RDS Subnet and Route53 internal DNS. The templates for this is found under files/cfs/. Some of these files are required to be uploaded to a S3 Bucket.

#### Upload CFS File to S3 bucket and make it available via http


This command will create a S3 bucket for our needs. Change the prefix to something unique to you.
```bash
$ aws --region us-east-2 s3 mb s3://<prefix>infra/
```

These commands uploads the CFS to a S3 bucket in your account. Change the s3:// address to a bucket in your account.
No need to reference region for any more AWS S3 commands. The system will find the correct bucket.

```bash
$ aws s3 cp files/cfs/Variable_VPC_4sbnt_1NAT.template s3://<prefix>infra/cf_templates/
$ aws s3 cp files/cfs/Variable_Internal_R53.template s3://<prefix>infra/cf_templates/
```

#### Build VPC
This command will use AWS CLI to execute the CloudFormation template. You will need to adjust the URL to the region your S3 bucket is in and the name of the s3 bucket.

While this command runs, you can view the status in the AWS Console, under CloudFormation, Select the stack that is CREATE_IN_PROGRESS and click on Events tab on the bottom window.
```bash
$ time aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name demo-vpc-use2 \
  --template-body file://files/cfs/Demo-AWS-VPC.template \
  --parameter ParameterKey=CFSS3Bucket,ParameterValue=http://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/<prefix>infra/cf_templates/ \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --on-failure DO_NOTHING
```

| Command Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| stack-name | Enter the CloudFormation stack name you want these to be named. Suggestion provided to state that this stack is a vpc and region information |
| template-body | The file location of the template to run. |
| parameter | This points to the S3 bucket that the variable templates have been uploaded to. |
| capabilities | This template is capable of creating IAM roles, but its disabled in this configurations |
| region | AWS region the VPC that will build in. |
| on-failure | Tells AWS CloudFormation to not delete the stack if it fails so the error can be identified. |


####Create Base AMI
Base AMI, is the common base OS image that all services are built off of. Any security, common user, or common package that is used throughout the cloud stack, is managed and applied during this process. (e.g. This AMI is use to build other services, launch Jenkins, NGNIX, Apache, MySQL, or any other EC2 instances.)

TIP: Change the ami to the ubuntu 18.04 LTS HVM version for your region.

```bash
$ time ansible-playbook services/default_base/build_base_ami.yml \
  --extra-vars "region=us-east-2 \
                source_ami=ami-06e2e609dbf389341 \
                infra_stack_name= demo-vpc-use2-<variable characters>"
```

| Command Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| region | AWS region the VPC that packer will build the AMI in. |
source_ami | AMI that is already created in AWS. e.g. Ubuntu 14.04 HVM created AMI from Canonical.
 infra_stack_name | The Name of the CloudFormation stack to launch into. You will need to go to the AWS Console and get the full name of the VPC CloudFormation stack. It will be something similar to "demo-vpc-use2-1RGHN7QWOPHNB". This is a substack in the master nested stack of the "demo-vpc-use2" stack.


#### Destroy VPC
Cleans up the VPC build.
If there are any servers running inside the VPC or anything changed manually to the VPC's or networking that relate to the VPC's, this will fail until those items are cleaned up or removed. You will need to adjust the URL to the region your S3 bucket is in and the name of the s3 bucket. You can test the URL out by entering the address in a Web Browser.

```bash
$ time aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name --stack-name <prefix>-vpc-use2 \
  --region us-east-2
```
